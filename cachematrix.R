## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function calculates a matrix inverse
## The inverse is cached and if the cache is 
## valid the cached value is returned. 
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
